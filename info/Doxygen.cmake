# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in

set(DOXYGEN_INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS YES)

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or
# enum is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.

set(DOXYGEN_TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT YES)

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in

# alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original file.
# When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you have to
# escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts with the
# commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and @} or use
# a double escape (\\{ and \\})

# Configuration options related to the input files

# The INPUT_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program that doxygen should

# by executing (via popen()) the command:
#
# <filter> <input-file>
#
# where <filter> is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the
# name of an input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter
# program writes to standard output. If FILTER_PATTERNS is specified, this tag
# will be ignored.
#
# Note that the filter must not add or remove lines; it is applied before the
# code is scanned, but not when the output code is generated. If lines are added
# or removed, the anchors will not be placed correctly.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# properly processed by doxygen.

# If SOURCE_TOOLTIPS is enabled (the default) then hovering a hyperlink in the

# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might
# be necessary to disable the index and replace it with your own. The
# DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at top
# of each HTML page. A value of NO enables the index and the value YES disables
# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation
# tree, you can set this option to YES if you also set GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

set(DOXYGEN_DISABLE_INDEX NO)

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# Use this tag to change the font size of LaTeX formulas included as images in

# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
