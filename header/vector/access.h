 * @brief Return a pointer to the element in the @a vector at index @a i
 *
 * @note Though this operation doesn't have the @c _z suffix, it @b is a part of
 * the explicit interface and takes the element size of the @a vector as @a z.
 * This operation is redundant if the element type of the @a vector is known at
 * compile time as it's identical to <code>vector + i</code>.
 *
 * @note This operation is implemented as a macro but documented as a function
 * to clarify its intended usage.
 *
 * If @a i is the length of the @a vector then this will return a pointer to
 * just past the last element of the @a vector.
 *
 * This operation is @c const qualified on the @a vector. That is if the element
 * type of the @a vector is @c const qualified (@a vector is compatible with a
 * @ref vector_c), this will return a <tt>const void *</tt>. Otherwise this will
 * return a <tt>void *</tt>.
 *
 * This is the inverse of vector_index() such that:
 * @code{.c}
 *   vector_index(vector, vector_at(i)) == i
 *   vector_at(vector, vector_index(elmt)) == elmt
 * @endcode
 *
 * If @a i is neither an index in the @a vector or its length then the behavior
 * is undefined.
